# Purpose

Smiting is the Barbarian equivalent of attacking something.

# Commands

We basically borrow the synonyms for attacking from the Standard Rules (but we exclude 'torture', 'murder', 'punch', and 'thump' as inapproproate).

```
Smiting is an action applying to one visible thing.
Understand "smite [something]" as smiting.
Understand the commands "a", "attack", "break", "smash", "hit", "fight", "wreck", "crack", "destroy", "kill", "strike" as "smite".
```

# Help text

strike with powerful force.

# Effect

Increment the smite counter of the noun.

If we are smiting a locked container, we remember its contents (assumed to be a single object) and give it to the player.

If we are smiting a monster, and the monster is injured (but still alive), we cannot UNDO until the monster is defeated.
