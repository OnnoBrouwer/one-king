Dear Beta Tester, thank you for taking the time to look at my very first game.
This game aims to fulfill the requirements as originally set out for the
Single Choice Jam, with only one location where the Single Choice can be made,
and a limited set of commands available to the player as detailed in the online help.

Some commands are omitted from the provided help (please let me know
if any of these should be included in the player help; I prefer to keep
the help text minimal, but if needed I can split it into multiple pages):
 
VERIFY: Verifying the story file.
VERSION: Requesting the story file version.
SCRIPT ON: Switching the story transcript on (Beta Testers: Prepend your comments with * or punctuation).
SCRIPT OFF: Switching the story transcript off.
AGAIN/G: Disabled; normally repeats the previous command.
OOPS/O: Disabled; normally corrects a typo in the previous command.
 
I'm interested in any feedback you may have, aside from obvious bugs, such as:
 
- Any default responses that should be rewritten.
- Any instances of weird or flawed language use (English is not my native language; Dutch is).
- Regarding the previous point, I try to use US English. Please let me know if I made any mistakes.
- Your opinion on including the story mode commands in the final release of this game.
- Your opinion on including "standard" commands as alternatives in this game.
- Your general impression of this game and suggestions for improvements.
 
Please switch the story transcript on when you try out the game and put your comments in there. Any feedback is very much appreciated! Sincerely yours, Onno.
